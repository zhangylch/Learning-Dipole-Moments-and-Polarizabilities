# Learning-Dipole-moment-and-Polarizability
## 1. Introcuction
This repository saves the permanent dipole moment, transition dipolement and polarizabilty of N-methylacetamide (NMA) molecule.
The dataset includes 10000 NMA configurations from 1000 different protein backbones at room temperature from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
Permanent dipole moments and polarizabilities were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The perpendicular nπ* and parallel ππ* 
transition dipole moments were calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).
