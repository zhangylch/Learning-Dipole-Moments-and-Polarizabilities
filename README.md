# Learning-Dipole-moment-and-Polarizability
## 1. Introcuction:
Embedded atom neural network (EANN) is a python package implemented based on PyTorch framework used to fit interatomic potentials, dipole moment, trsnaition dipole moment and polarizability of various systems. This project is still under active development. The current version only includes a serializable model saved in the floder potentials generated by the torch Script compiler used to predict the dipole moment, trsnaition dipole moment and polarizability of N-methylacetamide (NMA) molecule. These models were trained by 10000 NMA configurations exacted from 1000 different protein backbones at room temperature from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The full package will be released soon. The dataset includes Permanent dipole moments and polarizabilities were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The perpendicular nπ* and parallel ππ* 
transition dipole moments were calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).
